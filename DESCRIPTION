Title: MSstats GUI for Statistical Anaylsis of Proteomics Experiments
Version: 1.0.6
Date: 2022-12-04
Description: MSstatsShiny is an R-Shiny graphical user interface (GUI) 
  integrated with the R packages MSstats, MSstatsTMT, and MSstatsPTM. It 
  provides a point and click end-to-end analysis pipeline applicable to a wide 
  variety of experimental designs. These include data-dependedent acquisitions (DDA)
  which are label-free or tandem mass tag (TMT)-based, as well as DIA, SRM, and 
  PRM acquisitions and those targeting post-translational modifications (PTMs). 
  The application automatically saves users selections and builds an R script 
  that recreates their analysis, supporting reproducible data analysis.
